# fractal-tree-opengl

Fundamental fractal tree rendered with OpenGL in C/C++ using recursive approach.

It's a demo for people that want to know the "low-level" implementation details, instead of just writing pre-made functions from a framework without much thought behind it.

*colours* branch, apart from implementing colours, also allows for dynamic depth changing. Use Q and W on your keyboard to lower (Q) or raise (W) the depth accordingly.
